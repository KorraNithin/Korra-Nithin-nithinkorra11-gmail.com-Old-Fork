# DECISIONS

One section per decision that a reviewer might reasonably have made differently. Every section has
the same four parts, and the third and fourth are the ones we weigh most.

Rules, from `DISCOVERY-BRIEF.md`:

- cite something real in `Why` — a commit, a test, an error string, a file and line
- do not restate what a document says; describe what you did when the documents ran out
- six to twelve decisions is the expected range

### <the decision, as a claim — not "permissions", but "the org-level view counts device-scoped grants">

Suspension is not an authentication failure

What I chose:
I decided to let suspended membership tokens pass authentication. The authenticate() function does not reject a user just because their membership status is suspended.

Why:
According to AUTH-DATA-MODEL.md §10, a suspended membership should return a 403 with an empty permission set. That means authentication should succeed first, and the suspension should be handled later by the permission/resolution layer.

What I rejected:
I considered rejecting suspended users directly in context.js with a 401, similar to a removed membership. But that would treat two different cases as the same: a removed user doesn't have access to the system, while a suspended user still exists but is temporarily blocked. The spec specifically keeps these cases separate.

What would change my mind:
If a hidden test or updated specification explicitly expected suspended memberships to return 401 instead of 403, I would change this behavior.

### Stub — the shape of a weak "Why"

**What I chose:** the obvious thing.
**Why:** it is what the brief says to do.
**What I rejected:** nothing, the alternative seemed worse.
**What would change my mind:** I do not know.

_Reads as a memory of the document, not a model of the system. Scores nothing._

### Stub — the shape of a strong "Why"

**What I chose:** X.
**Why:** I implemented Y first, because Y is the intuitive precedence rule. `node scripts/check-
permissions.js` reported `<the actual reason string it reported>` on the case where the two grants
disagree. That is only reachable if the two are evaluated in a different order than Y assumes.
Moved to X in `<commit>` and the case passed. Logged in `BUILD-LOG.md` under Phase 2.
**What I rejected:** Y, and also "resolve the narrower one last" — both fail the same case for the
same reason.
**What would change my mind:** a case where a narrower grant is expected to survive a broader
refusal. I could not construct one, which is itself evidence for X.

_Shows what you believed, what disproved it, and what you did next._

## Where this repo argues with itself

The documents contradict each other, or contradict the schema, in at least one place. Name each
one you found. For each: quote both statements, say which you built against, and say why.

Building against the written rule and arguing in writing is a **full-marks** answer. Silently
working around it, or quietly picking one and saying nothing, scores zero on the section — we
cannot tell the difference between a decision and an oversight.

## Deliberately not built

What you chose not to build, and the reason. A scope cut with a stated reason is a senior
judgement. An unmentioned gap is a gap.
